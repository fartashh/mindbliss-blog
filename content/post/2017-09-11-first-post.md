Monthly Recurring Revenue is one of the most important metrics you need for measuring health of your subscription business.
Recently I have done comprehensive research to find out how to calculate MRR. Although I have found so many good definitions but I haven't
found any practical one. In this post I will explain how to calculate MRR by using one of my favourite python libraries (Pandas).

## What is MRR and How calculate it?
Before we start, let's define MRR. Zuora defines MRR as bellow;

> Monthly recurring revenue (MRR) is a dollar amount derived from a companyâ€™s total annual recurring revenue (ARR), normalized to a monthly value. In its simplest form, MRR is the money paid monthly for a subscription to a product or service. Properly used, it can provide valuable, unique insight into sales and cash flow dynamics.

In order to understand it better, let's look at the following example;

> A new $120,000 annual contract starts on April 1, 2016 and ends on April 1, 2017.
> The question is How much Monthly Recurring Revenue was added and when?

The answer to this question is simple, $10,000 in April 2016, specifically April 1, 2016. In other word; if no one else subscribe,
the MRR form April 2016 till 2017 is $10,000.

According to the example, we need 3 parameters to be able to calculate the MRR;

* Subscription start date
* Subscription end date
* Value you are gonna get every day of month (I like to call it daily MRR but we can call it Monthly Recurring Charge MRC as well)

## MRR Calculation
calculating MRR for one subscription is clear but what about real world example, in which we have thousands or millions of records.
I break the process into two simple steps;

**1. Calculate total MRC for each day**
 For instance, if you want to generate report form 1 Jan 2015 till 30 Dec 2015, we need to calculate (TMRC) total sum of MRC for every
 day of the year.

date         | TMRC
-----------  | -------------
01 Jan 2015  | $180
02 Jan 2015  | $240
03 Jan 2015  | $590
...          | ...
...          | ...
27 Dec 2015  | $2080
28 Dec 2015  | $620
29 Dec 2015  | $900
30 Dec 2015  | $120
31 Dec 2015  | $780

TMRC of `nDate` is equal to sum of all MRCs of subscriptions which are active and they started in the same day of `nDate`


**2. Generate the report**
 Based on data prepared in step 1, we can generate two important reports;

 * Monthly Recurring Revenue which is equal to sum of all TMRC in one month.
 * Rolling Monthly Recurring Revenue which is equal to sum of all TMRC of last 30 days.

## Case study

I generate 16137 sample subscription records which you can download from [here](/data/post/how-calculate-mrr/sample-subscription.csv).
And you can find the Ipython notebook of following codes [here](/data/post/how-calculate-mrr/MRR-Report.ipynb).

Let's start to  generate the reports with pandas and matplotlib.


### Load required libraries


{{< highlight python >}}
    import csv
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    from datetime import timedelta, date
    %matplotlib inline
    import matplotlib
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
{{< /highlight >}}

### Data Preprocessing


{{< highlight python >}}
    # loading data
    df = pd.read_csv('sample-subscription.csv')
    report_start_date = date(2015,1,1)
    report_end_date = date(2015,12,1)

    # Data preprocessing
    df.fillna(report_end_date, inplace=True)
    df['subscription_start_date'] =pd.to_datetime(df['subscription_start_date'], format = '%Y-%m-%d')
    df['subscription_end_date'] =pd.to_datetime(df['subscription_end_date'], format = '%Y-%m-%d')
{{< /highlight >}}

### Calculate TMRC for each day



{{< highlight python >}}
    # Helper function
    def daterange(start_date, end_date):
        for n in range(int ((end_date - start_date).days)):
            yield start_date + timedelta(n)

    # calculate tmrc for every day
    daily_mrr=[]
    for my_date in daterange(report_start_date, report_end_date):
        my_date_df = df[(df['subscription_end_date']>=my_date )
                        & (df['subscription_start_date']<= my_date)
                        & (df['subscription_start_date'].apply(lambda x: x.day) == my_date.day)]
        tmrc = my_date_df['dmrc'].sum()
        daily_mrr.append({'date':my_date,'mrc':tmrc})

    # Visualization
    dates = matplotlib.dates.date2num([x['date'] for x in daily_mrr])
    y = [x['mrc'] for x in daily_mrr]
    plt.figure(figsize=(100,20))
    plt.plot_date(dates, y,'-')
    plt.rc('font',**{'family' : 'normal',
            'weight' : 'bold',
            'size'   : 40})
    plt.show()

### Generate Reports
since we have our daily MRR data, we can group it by Monthly or Weekly.

#### Monthly MRR


{{< highlight python >}}
    df = pd.DataFrame(daily_mrr)
    df = df.set_index(pd.DatetimeIndex(df['date']))
    # group by dataframe Monthly
    g_df= df.groupby(pd.TimeGrouper("m"))
    res = g_df.sum()
    res.sort_index()
    res['date']=res.index.to_datetime()
{{< /highlight >}}


{{< highlight python >}}
    dates = matplotlib.dates.date2num(res.index.to_pydatetime())
    y = res['mrc']
    plt.figure(figsize=(100,20))
    plt.plot_date(dates, y,'-')
    plt.rc('font',**{'family' : 'normal',
            'weight' : 'bold',
            'size'   : 40})
    plt.show()
{{< /highlight >}}


{{< img src="/images/post/how-calculate-mrr/output_10_0.png" title="" class="align-center">}}

#### Rolling MRR
As mentioned earlier, rolling MRR for each day is sum of daily MRR of past 30 days.


{{< highlight python >}}
    rolling_mrr = [{
                'date': x['date'],
                'mrc': x['mrc'] + sum([z['mrc'] for z in daily_mrr
                                       [0 if daily_mrr.index(x) < 30
                                        else
                                        daily_mrr.index(x) - 30:daily_mrr.index(x)]])} for x in daily_mrr]

    # visualization
    dates = matplotlib.dates.date2num([x['date'] for x in rolling_mrr])
    y = [x['mrc'] for x in rolling_mrr]
    plt.figure(figsize=(100,20))
    plt.plot_date(dates, y,'-')
    plt.rc('font',**{'family' : 'normal',
            'weight' : 'bold',
            'size'   : 40})
    plt.show()
